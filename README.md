A CLI (Command Line Interface) game is a type of game that runs entirely within a text-based environment, 
typically within a terminal or console window. Players interact with the game by typing commands or 
selecting options provided by the game through text prompts. CLI games often focus on gameplay mechanics
and storytelling rather than flashy graphics, making them suitable for a wide range of devices and platforms.
They can include various genres such as text adventures, puzzle games, strategy games, and simulations.
